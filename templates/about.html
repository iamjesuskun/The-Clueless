    As human beings, we all have the desire to explore, experience and engage with the world around us. Because of the 2020 global pandemic, many curious travellers have been unable to visit the wonders and attractions around the world, many more people remain confined to their homes even post-COVID. Our website aims to provide a platform for travellers to get a snapshot of what interesting places around the world are, whether to plan their future trips as travel opens up or simply to explore the world. Simply choose a continent or let our algorithm choose for you and begin exploring!
