**Travel 404**
## Inspiration
Under the Covid pretext, we recognise there are a lot of individuals who have been financially affected or time impaired by the pandemic and therefore are no longer able to afford a holiday, whether it be domestically or internationally. Yet we still wish to promote and share the wonders of this world with everyone. 

## What it does
We have chosen to create a travel randomiser which allows users to see the world virtually, with some degree of user control for those who have a direction of exploration. Otherwise they can let us choose for them!

## How we built it
Utilising HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
Collaboration between multiple participants

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a prototype of what we hope our project should look like

## What we learned
The integration of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an aesthetic and user friendly website

## What's next for Travel Randomiser
We plan to optimise our features with additions to cosmetics, including allowing the ability of them to plan a one day routine for travellers. Addition of Google Maps API as reference of user position to find interesting spots nearby
